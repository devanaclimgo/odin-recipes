      <h1>Tiramisu Cupcakes</h1>
      <h3>These tiramisu cupcakes have all the flavor of tiramisu, but in cupcake form, including a coffee soak and a mascarpone frosting. Feel free to increase the amount of coffee liqueur in the coffee soak to suit your tastes—or leave it out completely. Keep these cupcakes refrigerated, especially after frosting them.</h3>

      <li>2 large eggs, at room temperature</li>

      <li>1/4 teaspoon almond extract</li>

    </ul>
    <h3>Frosting</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>3/4 cup unsalted butter, softened</li>
      <li>2 1/2 cups confectioner's sugar</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons chilled heavy cream</li>

      <li>1 tablespoon unsweetened cocoa powder, or as needed</li>
    </ul>
  </section>
  <section class="steps">
  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Step 1:</b> Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line 2 standard cupcake pans with liners.</li>
    <li><b>Step 2:</b> Sift flour, baking powder, 3/4 teaspoon salt, baking soda, and nutmeg together in a bowl.</li>
    <li><b>Step 3:</b> In a large bowl, beat butter, vegetable oil, and sugar together with an electric mixer until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Add in eggs, vanilla, and almond extract and beat on medium-high speed for 3 minutes. Add in half of flour mixture and mix until just combined. Add in sour cream and milk, and mix until just combined. Add in remaining flour mixture and mix until just combined. Divide batter amongst the prepared cupcake pans, filling each liner just over 1/2 full.</li>
    <li><b>Step 4:</b> Bake in the preheated oven until cupcakes begin to turn golden brown and tops spring back when lightly touched, 22 to 26 minutes. Cool in the pans for 10 minutes before removing to a wire rack to cool completely, about 30 minutes.</li>
    <li><b>Step 5:</b> For coffee syrup, mix together hot water, espresso powder, sugar, and coffee liqueur until combined.</li>
    <li><b>Step 6:</b> Use a toothpick to poke several holes in the top of each cupcake. Carefully pour about 1 tablespoon of the coffee soak over the top of each cupcake.</li>
    <li><b>Step 7:</b> For mascarpone frosting: beat butter with an electric mixer until smooth, about 2 minutes. Beat in 1 cup confectioner's sugar until combined. Add in remaining 1 1/2 cups confectioner's sugar, vanilla, and salt; beat until totally smooth and combined. Add in heavy cream, and beat on medium speed until frosting is smooth and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Add in cold mascarpone and mix on low speed until just combined. Do not beat longer or frosting will curdle and separate. Pipe or frost cupcakes as desired.</li>
    <li><b>Step 8:</b> Place cocoa powder into a fine mesh sieve and gently sift cocoa powder over the top of frosted cupcakes. Refrigerate cupcakes for at least 30 minutes before serving. Store cupcakes in the refrigerator.</li>
  </ul>

    <h3>Cook's Note</h3>
    <p>If mascarpone is hard for you to find (like it is form me), you can use 8 ounces full-fat cream cheese, at room temperature. For frosting, cream 3/4 cup butter until smooth, about 2 minutes. Beat in softened cream cheese until smooth and combined. Add in 1 cup powdered sugar; mix until combined. Add in remaining 1 1/2 cups powdered sugar, 1 teaspoon vanilla, and pinch of salt and mix until totally smooth. Add in heavy cream, and beat mixture on medium-high speed until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Pipe or frost cupcakes as desired.</p>
